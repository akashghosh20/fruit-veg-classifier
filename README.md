## 🌟 Overview
The **Fruit and Vegetable Classifier** is a web-based deep learning application that classifies images of fruits and vegetables. Powered by **TensorFlow Lite**, this app enables users to upload images and predict the type of fruit or vegetable displayed. It demonstrates how machine learning models can be effectively deployed for real-world image classification.

This app is crafted with a clean and modern UI using **Streamlit** and is trained using the **Fruits-360 dataset**, encompassing a variety of 131 fruit and vegetable categories.

## 🔥 Features
- **Upload & Classify**: Upload an image (JPEG, PNG) of a fruit or vegetable, and the AI will identify it.
- **Fast Inference**: Leverages TensorFlow Lite for efficient and rapid image classification.
- **User-friendly UI**: Built with an attractive interface using Streamlit, enhanced with custom HTML/CSS styling.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Displays prediction results, with an optional bar chart for classification probabilities.
- **Developer Info Sidebar**: Quick links for GitHub, LinkedIn, and email for easy contact.
